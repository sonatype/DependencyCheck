# Release Notes

Please see the [dependency-check google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dependency-check) for the release notes on versions not listed below.

## [Version 3.2.1](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/tag/v3.2.1) (2018-05-28)

### Bug Fixes

- In some cases when using the Maven or Gradle plugins the GAV coordinates were not being added as an Identifier causing suppression rules to fail; this has been resolved (#1298)
- Documentation Update (SCM links in the maven site were broken) (#1297)
- False positive reduction (#1290)
- Enhanced logging output for TLS failures to better assist with debugging (#1269)
- Resolved a Null Pointer Exception (#1296)

## [Version 3.2.0](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/tag/v3.2.0) (2018-05-21)

### Security Fix

- Unsafe unzip operations ([zip slip](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability)), as reported by the Snyk Security Research Team, have been corrected. CVE-2018-12036 allows attackers to write to arbitrary files via a crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames.

### Bug Fixes

- The dependency-check-maven plugin no longer uses the [Central Analyzer](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/analyzers/central-analyzer.html) by default
- Updated dependency-check-maven so that it will not fail when your multi-module build has dependencies that have not yet been built in the reactor (See [#740](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/740))
  - Note if the required dependency has not yet been built in the reactor and the dependency is available in a configured repository dependency-check-maven, as expected, would pull the dependency from the repository for analysis. 
- Minor documentation updates
- False positive reduction
- Fixed the Gradle Plugin and Ant Task so that the temp directory is properly cleaned up after execution
- Removed TLSv1 from the list of protocols used by default (See [#1237](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/pull/1237))

### Enhancements

- Excess white space has been removed from the XML and HTML reports; the JSON report is still pretty printed (a future release will convert this to a configurable option)
- Better error reporting
- Changed to use commons-text instead of commons-lang3 as a portion of commons-lang3 was moved to commonts-text
- Added more flexible suppression rules with the introduction of the `until` attribute (see [#1145](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/1145) and [dependency-suppression.1.2.xsd](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-suppression.1.2.xsd)

## [Version 3.1.2](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/tag/v3.1.2) (2018-04-02)

### Bug fixes

- Updated the NVD URLs
- Updated documentation
- Add project references to the JSON and XML report; in aggregate scans using Maven or Gradle the dependencies
  will include a reference to the project/module where they were found
- The configuration option `versionCheckEnabled` was added to Maven to allow users to disable the check for
  new versions of dependency-check; this will be added to gradle plugin, Ant Task, and the CLI in a future release
- The XML and JSON reports were fixed so that the correct version number is displayed see [issue #1109](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/1109)
- The initial database creation time for H2 databases was improved
- Changes made to decrease false positive and false negatives


## [Version 3.1.1](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/tag/v3.1.1) (2018-01-29)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the Central Analyzer to use the updated SHA1 query syntax.
- Reverted change that broke Maven 3.1.0 compatability; Maven 3.1.0 and beyond is once again supported.
- False positive reduction.
- Minor documentation cleanup.


## [Version 3.1.0](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/tag/v3.1.0) (2018-01-02)

### Enhancements

- Major enhancements to the Node and NSP analyzer - the analyzers are now considered
  production ready and should be used in combination.
- Added a shutdown hook so that if the update process is interrupted while using an H2
  database the lock files will be properly removed allowing future executions of ODC to
  succeed.
- UNC paths can now be scanned using the CLI.
- Batch updates are now used which may help with the update speed when using some DBMS
  instead of the embedded H2.
- Upgrade Lucene to 5.5.5, the highest version that will allow us to maintain Java 7 support

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the CSV report output to correctly list all fields.
- Invalid suppression files will now break the build instead of causing ODC to
  skip the usage of the suppression analyzer.
- Fixed bug in Lucene query where LARGE entries in the pom.xml or manifest caused
  the query to break.
- General cleanup, false positive, and false negative reduction. 

## [Version 3.0.2](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/tag/v3.0.2) (2017-11-13)

### Bug fixes

- Updated the query format for the CentralAnalyzer; the old format caused the CentralAnalyzer to fail

## [Version 3.0.1](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/tag/v3.0.1) (2017-10-20)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a database connection issue that affected some usages.

## [Version 3.0.0](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/tag/v3.0.0) (2017-10-16)

- Several bug fixes and false positive reduction
  - The 2.x branch introduced several new false positives – but also reduced the false negatives
- Java 9 compatibility update
- Stability issues with the Central Analyzer resolved
  - This comes at a cost of a longer analysis time
- The CSV report now includes the GAV and CPE
- The Hint Analyzer now supports regular expressions
- If show summary is disabled and vulnerable libraries are found that fail the build details are no longer displayed in the console – only that vulnerable libraries were identified
- Resolved issues with threading and multiple connections to the embedded H2 database
  - This allows the Jenkins pipeline, Maven Plugin, etc. to safely run parallel executions of dependency-check
